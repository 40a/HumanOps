# What is HumanOps?
HumanOps is a set of principles which focus on the human aspects of running infrastructure. 

It deliberately highlights the importance of the teams running systems, not just the systems themselves. 

The health of your infrastructure is not just about hardware, software, automations and uptime - it also includes the health and wellbeing of your team.

The goal of HumanOps is to improve and maintain the good health of your team: easing communication, reducing fatigue and reducing stress.
